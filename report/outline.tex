\section{Outline}

The structure of the article is as follows:

First we will briefly explain how medical resonance imaging is
performed.

Then we will present the magnetic fields involved in more detail and
the Bloch Equations that descripe how those fields affect the atom's
magnetic spin.

A description is then given of how the signal from the spin is
acquired and stored in K-space. This will include a short description
of how the data is transformed from K-space to image space by
appliying a 2D Fourier Transform.

We will then proceed to descripe our implementation of an MRI
simulator on the GPU.

Finally we will conclude our work and present future work and
usecases.
