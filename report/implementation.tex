\section{Implementation}

% model the B0 and BGf fields

% Assume slice selection and possibly phase gradient

% One kernel for Calculating several/all timesteps and store them in
% an array. (one thread pr voxel in the original image)

% Then have one kernel sum up the signal and write it in out k-space
% image.

% A last kernel will transform the image back to image space. Use
% Sangilds fft wrapper.

% If this image looks like crap then we don't care! Some mumbo jumbo
% about where it might have gone wrong, possible some images showing
% the net magnetization (with color interpretation) and then that's
% all she wrote.

%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-master: t
%%% TeX-PDF-mode: t
